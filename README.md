# VDFaceTracking

This is a Resonite mod, which lets the game read facial expressions and eye gaze directly from WiVRn.

This was patched together from [EyeTrackVRResonite](https://github.com/galister/EyeTrackVRResonite) and [VDFaceTracking](https://github.com/Zeitheron/VDFaceTracking) VRCFT module.

To install this mod go grab the release [over here](https://github.com/ItsAlphaNeon/WiVRnFaceTracking/releases/latest) and put it into `Resonite\rml_mods\` folder.

You are going to need [Resonite Mod Loader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader), read how to install it there.
